# Terraform Implementation Overview

The Terraform implementation provides the same functionality as the CloudFormation templates but with the benefits of Terraform's HCL syntax and state management.

## Key Components

1. **ECR Repository (ecr.tf)**: Creates the ECR repository for storing Docker images
2. **ECS Cluster (ecs-cluster.tf)**: Creates the ECS cluster with support for both Fargate and EC2 launch types
3. **ECS Service (ecs-service.tf)**: Creates the ECS service and task definition
4. **Variables (variables.tf)**: Defines all configurable parameters
5. **Outputs (outputs.tf)**: Defines output values for reference
6. **Helper Scripts**: Scripts for deploying and managing resources

## Terraform State Management

By default, the Terraform implementation uses local state. For production environments, consider:

1. Using remote state with S3 and DynamoDB
2. Implementing state locking
3. Using Terraform workspaces for multiple environments

Example backend configuration:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "your-terraform-state-bucket"
    key            = "contrast-dotnet-ecs/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-lock"
    encrypt        = true
  }
}
```
